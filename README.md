# BusinessDocsTemplates

Repository for hosting organisation's business documentation templates.

## How to use templates?

- Copy Business Requirements, MVP and SAD files into desired repo,
- Change "projectname" placeholder in each file name to given project naming,
- Fill up every file with project's data in given order: Business Requirements, MVP, SAD,

There is small relation between Business Requirements and MVP files, but with some modifications all files can be used independently from each other.

## Repo Workflow

This repo is not included into default organisation's procedures.

If there is some need for any modifications in templates, new version is created with tagging on repo.
